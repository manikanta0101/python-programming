# python program to find the difference between sum of square and square of sum N numbers

n=int(input("Enter the n value:"))
sum1=0
sum2=0
for i in range(1,n+1):
    sum1+=i*i
for i in range(1,n+1):
    sum2+=i
square=sum2*sum2
print("Difference =",square-sum1)

output:
Enter the n value:5
Difference = 170
